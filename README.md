Here is a collection of files for the RF Powermeter with Teensy 4.0/4.1.
Since I could not find any source files for the PCB, I designed two boards based on Robert Entwistle (WA2T) and the really impressive software by Johan G. Holstein (PD0LEW).
The Rev3n is based on a main board on which different RF boards can be plugged to find the best solution for each application.


I try to create a complete folder with all files here, my board files are welcome to be used and improved.

The board was designed with Kicad and the enclosure parts are designed with Inventor.
