Here is a collection of files for the RF Powermeter with Teensy 4.1 (a Teensy 4.0 can also be used with restrictions).
Since I could not find any board files, I designed two boards based on Robert Entwistle (WA2T) and really impressive Software from Johan G. Holstein (PD0LEW).
The Rev3n is based on a mainboard on which different RF boards can be plugged to find the best solution for each application.


I am trying to create a complete folder with all files here, my board files are welcome to be used and improved.

The board was designed with Kicad and the housing parts are designed with Inventor.
