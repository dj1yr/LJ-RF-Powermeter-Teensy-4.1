Here is a collection of files for the RF Powermeter with Teensy 4.1 (a Teensy 4.0 can also be used with restrictions).
Since I could not find any board files, I designed my own board based on the version by Robert Entwistle, WA2T.
The firmware is being further developed by Johan G. Holstein and is really impressive.

I am trying to create a complete folder with all files here, my boardfiles are welcome to be used and improved.

The board was designed with Kicad and the case parts are designed with Inventor.
